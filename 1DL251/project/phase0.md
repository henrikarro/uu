Phase 0
=======

SCRUMstudy defines five phases for Scrum, including an "Initiate" phase that is similar to what we mean by phase 0:

Project example
---------------
- Journal system for a hospital

Presentation
------------
- Big Design Up Front = Bad
- Give some examples of criticism of planning in agile, like YAGNI
- Big Picture Up Front = Good

Group Work
----------
- Divide the class into four groups
- Discuss what may be good to plan to get the big picture up front (5 minutes)
- Present the results, write on a blackboard

Presentation
------------
- Present our ideas for phase 0, and briefly define what we mean by the different artifacts:
  - Vision and goals
  - Find stakeholders
  - Form team
  - Create initial backlog
  - (Release planning)
  - Initial architecture
  - (Paper prototype of UI)

Group work
----------
- Explain the project
- Choose two groups as customer teams, and two groups as development teams.
- Describe the different roles (the developers will build the system, the customers will be available to answer questions, the two teams will communicate continuously).
- Pair each customer team with a develpment team.
- Ask the groups to come up with (10-15 minutes):
  - Vision and goals
  - Find stakeholders
- Present the results (5 minutes)

Presentation
------------
- We present examples of vision and goals, and stakeholders
- (Present impact mapping as a technique of finding vision and goals, and mapping user stories to goals.)
- Quickly repeat the Scrum terms backlog, user story, epic.

Group work
----------
- Have the teams create an initial backlog of around 5 user stories (around 10 minutes, ask the teams to indicate when they're done).
- Present the result

The user stories will be used in the next section on Specificaiton by Example.
