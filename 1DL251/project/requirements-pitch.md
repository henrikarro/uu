Requirements Group Project
==========================

The requirements group has decided to focus on two different areas within the field of requirements engineering: a phase 0 that may be useful in some types of project to do some initial planning before the development starts; and Specification by Example, which is a way to clarify requirements using concrete examples of the expected functionality.

Phase 0
=======

It has been the experience of some of the group members that some types of project may benefit from an initial planning phase before the development begins.

In the agile world, there is a wide-spread belief that all kinds of planning is bad. We would like to investigate if there are certain types of project, for example, large projects that are building a complex and completely new system, or projects having a sophisticated user interface, that would be more successful if a phase 0 is explicitly added to the project. This phase may for example be used to define vision and goals of the project, to find all relevant stakeholders, and perhaps build a paper prototype of the user interface.

Learning outcomes
-----------------

* What problems are we trying to solve with a phase 0?
* What artifacts to produce for different kinds of projects?
* When is a phase 0 necessary?
* What criticism is there to having a phase 0?
* How much of a phase 0 should you use in a particular project?
* What is the difference between phase 0 and sprint 0?


Knowledge gathering
-------------------

* Reading relevant parts of Sommerville, at least chapters 3 and 4
* Reading User Centered Agile Methods by Hugh Beyer
* Post-mortem analyses of agile projects
* Interviewing or asking people in the industry
* Asking people on devrant


Questions for devrant and interviews
------------------------------------
Here are ideas for questions to ask on devrant and during interviews:

* Do you do any sort of planning before you start an agile project? For example, to define a product vision, to find stakeholders, to produce an initial product backlog, etc?
* Do you use Specification by Example (Acceptance Test-Drive Development, Behavior-Driven Development)? What tools do you use?
* How many people are working on the project?
* How long is the project?
* Are you building a new system or maintaining an existing one?
* Who is the target user? Is it consumers, businesses, ...?
* Does the system you're building have a complex user interface, or is it mainly backend?
* How many people are working at the company?
* How old is the company?
* In which country are you based?

Knowledge transfer
------------------

Our basic idea is to first have a short introduction of what we mean by phase 0, and then to split the class into four groups working on two separate project. The groups working on a project will be either a customer or a developer team.

We then let the groups run through an imaginary phase 0 for their project, developing for example user stories, vision and goals and perhaps some other artifacts. The groups then present what they have produced.

We then also cover the sprint planning for the first development sprint. In this part, the customer team for project 1 becomes the developer team for project 2, and vice versa. The teams will have to decide if they think they need a technical sprint 0 or not. The teams will also run planning poker for estimates. The result of this exercise is an estimated sprint backlog.

Knowledge Assessment
--------------------

We plan to use an online quiz to assess the students, using for example kahoot.it or Google Forms. This will be a combined assessment that covers both Phase 0 and Specification by Example.

If possible, we may do this as a competition where the winner wins a choclate bar. 

All students will need to bring a phone or a computer for this to work.


Specification by Example
========================

Specification by Example is a way of working in an agile process where you clarify requirements at the start of a sprint by giving conrete examples of how the customer expects the system to work.

It has been the experience of some of the group members that this has several benefits: it clarifies the requirements and finds corner cases that are easy to miss otherwise; it provides regression testing; and it also provides documentation that is actually kept up-to-date.

We would like to learn more about what Specification by Example is, how it is used in practice, and if there are certains types of projects that benefit more from this way or working.

Learning outcomes
-----------------

* Basic understanding of SbE
* Understand practical agile development using SbE
* How SbE is used in a project and what impact it has on the project
* Timeline for a project using SbE compared to a project that does not use it
* Ideas of some tools
* How SbE fits different types of systems, for example APIs and complex user interfaces

Knowledge gathering
-------------------

* Reading relevant parts of the book by Adzic
* Interviews and devrant questions
* Trying to use one of the tools in some small project

Knowledge transfer
------------------

* A short introduction using slides
* Workshop with live testing starting from user stories, developing examples, and writing code
* Show a timeline of a project using both phase 0, sprint 0 and SbE
